# Prisere Insurance Renewal Comparison Tool ‚Äì Frontend PRD (v0)

## 1. Overview

**Product Name (Working Title):** Insurance Renewal Comparison Tool

**Goal:** Help small business owners understand when their renewal insurance policy no longer covers everything their previous plan did.

**Purpose:** Translate complex policy changes into plain-language insights so SMBs can make informed coverage decisions.

---

## 2. Problem & Opportunity

- Small businesses often renew insurance policies without realizing coverage has changed.
- Policy language is intentionally complex, and brokers' explanations are inconsistent.
- This creates hidden risk: SMBs may be **underinsured** or **overpaying for less coverage**.
- By simplifying renewal comparisons, Prisere can **build trust**, **educate SMBs**, and **strengthen resilience** before disasters occur.

---

## 3. Target Users

**Primary:** Retail SMB owners with limited insurance literacy

**Jobs to Be Done**
- "When my renewal arrives, I want to know what changed, in plain English."
- "I want to see if I'm losing coverage or paying more for less."
- "I want a checklist of what to ask my broker."
