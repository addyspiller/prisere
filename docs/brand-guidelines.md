# Prisere Brand Guidelines

## Brand Values (to apply to app design)

- **Resilient**: Prioritize claimant needs. Ensure the app feels like a safety net, not a burden.
- **Civic-Minded**: Position the tool as community-oriented—empowering SMBs to recover quickly and strengthen their neighborhoods.
- **Learning-Focused**: Provide educational context (tooltips, glossaries) so users walk away smarter about insurance.
- **Accessible**: Use simple language, large clear visuals, and intuitive workflows. Avoid jargon.
- **Trust**: Transparency is non-negotiable—show what the AI compared, why it flagged changes, and how the user can double-check.
- **Available**: Deliver timely insights; make sure policy comparisons are processed quickly.
- **Practical**: Focus on actionable outputs (clear report, specific guidance), not abstract analytics.
- **Clear**: Present policy changes in a clean, structured way. Prioritize readability over detail-dumps.
